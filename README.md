This all started because my step daughter (Abigail) kept asking me to
quiz her in maths.

I decided to start writting a program that would ask the questions for
me. But then I thought about capturing scores, maybe adding rewards and
branching out to leaderboards and competition style quiz questions.

Eventually I'll wrap this in a GUI and it can be a nice little game for
all my kids.
