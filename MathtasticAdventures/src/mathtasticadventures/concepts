config:

store prefered operators such as + - / * as flags in a 4 bit word
e.g. 0001 = additions only, 0011 = additions and substractions, 1001 = multiplication and addition only

Therefore:
            Addition = 1
            Subtraction = 2
            Division = 4
            Multiplication = 8
